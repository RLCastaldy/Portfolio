      <h1>I am an aspiring developer hoping to break into the professional world of web development.
      I am eager to get started with a company so I can continue building on the core concepts we learned in bootcamp.<br></br> <br></br>
      I am familiar with working on front end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JS. I also have some experience working with MySQL, MongoDB, and various NPM packages. I can create a restful API and make calls to it with Node JS. I am capable of creating routes to retrieve, post, and delete data as well as test them in Insomnia.<br></br><br></br>
      Though these are the primary technologies I have been exposed to, I am not shy about learning and embrace the growth that comes with each new experience.</h1>
